728’s Unofficial Land Navigation Test Study Guide
See also Land Navigation Academy Class Slides


1.0 - Declination
Understand what declination is and be able to define it. Understand how to convert between Magnetic and True north and where to apply it.


* Class video:  True North, Magnetic North, Grid North; Magnetic Declination.
* Difference between Magnetic North and True North (in degrees). El Dorado County is 13°.
* Convert Magnetic to True - Compass to Map Add (turn bezel to the right to add 13°)
* Convert True to Magnetic - Map to Compass Subtract (turn bezel to the left to minus 13°)
* Don’t just do the math in your head, especially when 0° is near the index.
* “Magnetic North” - direction a magnetized compass needle points as it aligns to Earth’s magnetic field
* “True North” - direction of shortest distance between anyplace on the earth’s surface and “North Pole”


2.0 - Map datum
The searcher shall understand what a datum is and its uses in navigation. The searcher will demonstrate changing datums. 


* Datum - A 3D “model” of the earth based on thousands of benchmark measurements (physical reference points against other maps points that are surveyed)
* 3 options, we use WSG-84
   * NAD-27: North American Datum of 1927 (United States Geodetic Survey - USGS)
   * NAD-83: North American Datum of 1983
   * WGS-84: World Geodetic Survey of 1984


3.0 - UTM system
What is the UTM system and how is the UTM system used in SAR. 


* UTM is a 2D coordinate grid system dividing the earth into meters, map distance major grid is 1k
* Easting - West to East (60 Zones)
   * Zone 1 starts at 180 West of Longitude (Greenwich, England)
   * Zone 60 ends at 180 East of Longitude
* Northing - South to North (24 letters, A-Z no I, O) 
   * Equator is O (not shown on map)
   * A and B reserved for South pole, Y and Z reserved for North pole
* California in zones 10S, 10T, 11S
* Read Zone, Easting, Northing (read Right then Up)

4.0 - Orienting map
The searcher will be expected to be able to orient a map to the terrain using a compass. 


Class video: SMCT: Orient a Map Using a Lensatic Compass.
Alternative quick video: Wilderness Navigation Skills- Orientating a Map with a Compass.
* Methodical Method
   1. Orient the map to the terrain (check that the bottom map symbol is facing up). 
   2. Set the compass bezel to 0°.
   3. Align the compass edge to a map grid line.
   4. (Magnetic North) Rotate the map until red is in the shed.
   5. (True North) Turn the bezel right to add 13° (347°), rotate map, red in the shed.
* Shortcut:
   1. (True North) Bezel to 347° > align compass edge to map grid line, rotate map, red in the shed.


5.0 - Map terrain features 
The searcher will be expected to be familiar with the features of topo maps. The searcher will be asked to identify three (3) terrain features on a map chosen by the Evaluator. 


Class videos: Major Terrain Features on a Hand, Contours & Elevation, Contours & Terrain
* Major features (“Hidden Valley Ranch Salad Dressing” video)
   * Hills - ground goes down in all directions
   * Valleys - ground goes up in 3, down in one
   * Ridgelines - ground goes down in 3, up in 1
   * Saddles - connects two mountains, contour lines can bend inward
   * Depressions - low spot, ground goes up in all directions
* Minor features
   * Spur - (fingers) juts off from ridgeline (runny egg, contour lines go down)
   * Draw - (btw fingers), formed by runoff and forms spurs (creeks flow down, contour lines go up)
   * Cliff - contour lines are really close together, very steep
   * Cut - looks like a zipper


Hints on what to look for to identify terrain features:
* Hills/Mountains: concentric circles, elevation increase. Summit - innermost loop, sometimes has “X”. 
* Valleys/Draws: “V” or “U” shaped lines that point uphill (shaped by water flowing down).
* Ridges/Spurs: opposite of valleys, “V” or “U” shaped lines that point downhill. Often connects peaks.
* Saddles/Passes: between two concentric circles (peaks), can be hourglass shaped.
* Depressions: circle with tick marks on the inside indicating elevation decrease towards the center.

* Class videos - Latitude and Longitude, How to read Latitude and Longitude Coordinates.
* Traditionally, Earth divided in circles or 360 degrees (still a sphere), 60 min per degree, 60 secs per min
* Today, users divide degrees or minutes in 10th, 100th, and 1000ths
   * Referred to as “decimal degrees” or “decimal minutes”
* Reference is Equator and 0 degrees in Greenwich England
* 3 different formats (which one is used by EDSAR)

            4. (True North) Read the bearing at the index (compass N/orienting arrow should be pointing to map’s N).
            5. (Magnetic North) Before walking, subtract 13°, red in the shed, move in direction of travel arrow.


21.0 - Triangulation to find location 
The searcher will be given two (2) bearings to landmarks on a map and will determine the intersecting location by triangulating. Alternate scenario, the searcher will determine their location by triangulation to two (2) visible landmarks that are also located on a map. 


NEEDLE DOESN’T MATTER AND YOU DON’T KNOW YOUR DIRECTION OF TRAVEL.


See video
            1. Orient the map to the terrain landmarks.
            2. Get both bearings by pointing the compass, red in the shed.

            1. Rotate the bezel to the landmark’s bearing.
            2. Place the compass corner on top of the landmark (direction of travel points to the landmark).
            3. Pivot the compass corner until the orienting lines match the map line (needle is not important!).
            * Use the back azimuth if you're falling off the map when you pivot.
            4. Make sure the compass bezel N/red orienting arrow is pointing towards the top of the map.
            5. Draw a long line on the map. The two lines from each landmark should intersect.
